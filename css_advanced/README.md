HTML & CSS Advanced Project

This project is based on the HTML, advanced project and expands on it by implementing the full design from a Figma file, applying modern and responsive CSS styling. The final result mirrors the Figma layout and design intent as closely as possible, using semantic HTML5 and clean, maintainable CSS.

🚀 Overview

You will find here:

Semantic HTML layout (structured in index.html)

CSS styling (via styles.css) that respects the design shared in Figma

Responsive and flexible design using Flexbox

Accessible structure using best HTML practices
