    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With HTML, you can create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</p>
    
    <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
    
    <p>Learning HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer. It provides the structure for your web content and is often complemented by CSS for styling and JavaScript for behavior.</p>
    
    <p>The best way to learn HTML is through practice. Create small projects, experiment with different tags, and gradually build more complex pages as you become more comfortable with the language.</p>
