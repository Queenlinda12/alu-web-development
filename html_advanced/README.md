# 0x00. HTML - From Figma to HTML

## 📌 Description

This project is part of the ALU Web Development curriculum. The objective is to convert a webpage design from **Figma** into a clean, semantic HTML document — focusing only on **HTML structure**, with **no CSS or styling**.

You'll build the layout based purely on the visual and structural cues from the design.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the basics of working with Figma
- Convert design structure into semantic HTML
- Use proper HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Write accessible and organized HTML code
- Ensure clean code hierarchy and structure

## 🖼️ Figma Design

The webpage design is available via Figma.
